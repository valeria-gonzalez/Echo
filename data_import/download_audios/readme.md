# README â€“ `test.py`

## Description

`test.py` is the main script designed to **download audio files for sentences and words from Tatoeba**. This script automates the retrieval of audio files associated with processed datasets, saving them locally for further use in applications such as language learning, speech processing, or NLP tasks.

The script uses two specialized downloader classes:

- **DownloadSentences**: Downloads sentence audio files from the dataset.
- **DownloadWords**: Downloads word audio files from the dataset.

---

## Features

1. Configures **logging** to track download progress and errors.
2. Defines paths to the processed JSONL datasets for sentences and words.
3. Specifies local destination directories for downloaded audio files.
4. Instantiates downloader objects for sentences and words.
5. Executes the download process for all audio files by calling `_json_download()` on each downloader.
