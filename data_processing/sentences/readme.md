# 📁 Tatoeba Sentence Processing

## 📚 Objective

In order to provide practice sentences for the project, relevant information pertaining to english sentences provided by different files from Tatoeba.org must be extracted and saved into a single file.

The needed information for a sentence is the following:

- English sentence
- Spanish sentence translation
- Link to audio pronunciation

## 🌐 What is Tatoeba?

Tatoeba is a large database of sentences and translations. Its content is ever-growing and results from the voluntary contributions of thousands of members.

Tatoeba provides a tool for you to see examples of how words are used in the context of a sentence. You specify words that interest you, and it returns sentences containing these words with their translations in the desired languages.

Special thanks and acknowledgments to Tatoeba.

## 📂 Dataset description

All the files used in this project were obtained from [tatoeba.org/downloads](https://tatoeba.org/en/downloads).

Tateoba offers data related to sentences under the creative commons license that is useful for developing language tools or processing data. Under a variety of categories, it's possible to download csv or tsv files containing information.

For the information needed for this project, the following files were used:

- **Category: Sentence pairs**

  - **File Description:** All sentences in language A that are translated into language B, along with the translations (download English - Spanish).
  - **Origin Filename:** `Sentence pairs in English-Spanish -YYYY-MM-DD.tsv`
  - **Fields and structure:** Sentence id [tab] Text [tab] Translation_id [tab] Text

- **Category: Sentences (CC0)**

  - **File Description:** Contains all the sentences available under Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license in a specific language.
  - **Origin Filename:** `eng_sentences_CC0.tsv`
  - **Fields and structure:** Sentence id [tab] Lang [tab] Text [tab] Date last modified

- **Section: Sentences with audio**

  - **File Description:** Contains the ids of the sentences, in all languages, for which audio is available.
  - **Origin Filename:** `sentences_with_audio.csv`
  - **Fields and structure:** Sentence id [tab] Audio id [tab] Username [tab] License [tab] Attribution URL
  - **Note:** A single sentence can have one or more audio, each from a different voice. To download a particular audio, use its audio id to compute the download URL. For example, to download the audio with the id 1234, the URL is https://tatoeba.org/audio/download/1234.

## 📜 Overview

## ✨ Results
### Final csv file description

The `get_sentences_csv` method will create a file, by default named `tatoeba_sentences.csv` in the current directory. 

It will contain all the english sentences under the Creative Commons Zero (CCO) license that also have audio and a spanish translation.

The csv file is separated by commas as a delimiter. The file has the following fields:

- `eng_id` : Id of the english sentence in Tatoeba
- `eng_sentence` : Text of english sentence
- `spa_id` : Id of the spanish translation of the sentence in Tatoeba
- `spa_sentence` : Text of spanish translation sentence
- `audio_id` : Id of the audio pronunciation file of the english sentence

This is the format of the csv file:
```
eng_id,eng_sen,spa_id,spa_sen,audio_id
403859,"If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put U and I together.",690143,"Si pudiera reordenar el alfabeto, pondría la T y la Q juntas.",1123747
```

### Final jsonl file description

The `get_sentences_jsonl` method will create a file, by default named `tatoeba_sentences.jsonl` in the current directory. 

It will contain all the english sentences under the Creative Commons Zero (CCO) license that also have audio and a spanish translation.

The json file is an array of json objects with the following keys.

- `eng_sentence`: (str) Text of english sentence
- `spa_sentence`: (str) Text of spanish translation sentence
- `audio_id`: (int) Id of the audio pronunciation file of the english sentence

This is the format of the json object: 

```json 
{
    "eng_sen": "If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put U and I together.", 
    "spa_sen": "Si pudiera reordenar el alfabeto, pondr\u00eda la T y la Q juntas.",
    "audio_id": 1123747
}
```

This is the format of the jsonl file:

```jsonl
[{"eng_sen": "If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put U and I together.", "spa_sen": "Si pudiera reordenar el alfabeto, pondr\u00eda la T y la Q juntas.", "audio_id": 1123747}]
```
