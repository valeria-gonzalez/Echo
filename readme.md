# Echo: English Pronunciation App

Web application that evaluates english pronunciation using AI and provides practice resources such as words, sentences and texts with audio.

## Description



## Getting Started

###  1. Save all data to a dataset folder
Please save all of your data (such as .csv, .zip files) that aren't directly related to the data processing scripts in a folder named `datasets`. The `.gitignore` file will ignore it no matter where it is.

If you are creating a virtual environment for python, please name it `env` so it's ignored as well.

If you are creating any other folder that isn't relevant to all of us, kindly add it to the `.gitignore` file and update it here so we're all aware of the changes.

```
env
**/datasets/*
```
