##  🔊 What is echo?

It is a web application for pronunciation assessment and feedback for passive English speakers between the ages of 18 and 30. This application uses audio recordings of the speaker that emulate English audio and transcripts as teaching material. It will be developed as a web application, will use different artificial intelligence models to evaluate the audio, and will store the teaching material and user information in a database.

## ❓ Why echo? 
Nowadays, mastery of the English language has become essential to have better social and work opportunities. The project seeks to attack the problem in which thousands of people find themselves, which is to learn to pronounce well, so the passive speaker will be able to use this tool to improve in the language and discover their weaknesses 

## 🚀 What does echo do? 
Improve the pronunciation of passive English speakers through a system that uses Artificial Intelligence models to evaluate and feed back recordings of the speaker's pronunciation by emulating audios and transcriptions in English used as teaching material.

## 🚀 List of Project Functions
- `Functionality` 🎧 Provide audios and transcriptions of words, sentences, and texts as teaching materials.
- `Functionality` 🎙️ Allow the user to create audio recordings of the teaching material.
- `Functionality` 🤖 Provide AI feedback on the user's pronunciation.
- `Functionality` 🧠 Filter words, sentences, and texts by difficulty level.
- `Functionality` 🔍 Filter words, sentences and texts by usage situation.

### Moonshot:
* Generate audios and transcriptions using AI from a free request from the user on any topic.
* Generate audios and transcriptions using AI from text manually entered by the user.
* Allow the exchange between users of messages translated into English and their audios to receive feedback.

## 💡 Desing Vision?
**Echo should look like a user-friendly, educational website.**
