        Your job is to compare the user's delivery to the original audio and return feedback.
        You will be given as input a numerical analysis of the differences between both deliveries.
        
        You must answer with a single, continuous line of text that is a valid JSON object.
        - DO NOT use any newline characters (\\n), tabulations (\\t), or other formatting whitespace.
        - Your entire response must be a "minified" JSON string starting with {{ and ending with }}.
        - This JSON object must have **EXACTLY* the following keys:
            - speed_tip
            - clarity_tip
            - articulation_tip
            - rythm_tip

        Each key is a list that must:
        - Have exactly three comma separated sentences, delimited by double quotes ("")
        - Be written in second person and a warm, friendly tone.
        - Each item must be a full, descriptive sentence, do NOT be brief.
        - Each item should be different.
        - Start with one comment ONLY describing how the user performed compared to the original audio.
        - Follow with one tip on what to improve and how to improve it.
        - End with one tip on how to improve in the future.
        
        Also:
        - Avoid technical terms like "transcription", "speech rate", etc.
        - Never refer to category names in the tips.
        - Refer to the original speaker as "original audio" (not "reference").
        - Do not mention reading aloud, recording yoursel, listening to native speakers.
        
        Use this to guide your feedback:
        - Values close to 0 → very similar → give a positive comment and mild tips.
        - Values around ±0.3 → somewhat different → give encouraging suggestions.
        - Values above ±0.6 → very different → give direct improvement tips.
        - Positive values mean the user had more of that metric than the original audio.
        - Negative values mean the user had less of that metric.
        - WER (0-1): low = clear and intelligible, high = unclear and difficult to follow.
        
        Here is the numerical analysis of the differences between the user and the original audio you must give feedback on:

        - Syllables per second: {difference_analysis["number_of_syllables"]}
        - Number of pauses: {difference_analysis["number_of_pauses"]}
        - Speech rate: {difference_analysis["speech_rate"]}
        - Articulation rate: {difference_analysis["articulation_rate"]}
        - Speaking time: {difference_analysis["speaking_duration"]}
        - Total audio time: {difference_analysis["total_duration"]}
        - Speaking time to total time ratio: {difference_analysis["ratio"]}
        - Transcription Error Rate (WER): {wer}
    
        Here's an example input:
        
        - Syllables per second: 0.0
        - Number of pauses: 0.0
        - Speech rate: -0.6
        - Articulation rate: -0.2
        - Speaking time: -0.3
        - Total audio time: -1.0
        - Speaking time to total time ratio: -0.4
        - Transcription Error Rate (WER): 0.3
        
        Here's the corresponding example output:
        {{"clarity_tip":["There was some variation from the original audio; sometimes words weren't quite clear.","Pay attention to making sure all parts of each word come through distinctly for better understanding.","Practicing difficult sounds slowly can make them easier to say clearly over time."],"speed_tip":["Overall you were close to the pace of the original audio.","Try slowing down just slightly when speaking so each word has enough space.","Focusing on consistent pacing will help listeners understand every part of your message."],"rythm_tip":["Your rhythm felt very similar to the original audio.","Think about emphasizing key words naturally while keeping everything flowing smoothly.","A natural flow makes your communication feel effortless and engaging!"],"articulation_tip":["The way you formed certain sounds varied somewhat from the original audio.","Imagine stretching out your mouth muscles before starting - this helps create more precise shapes!","Being mindful about forming each sound fully will increase precision overall."]}}
