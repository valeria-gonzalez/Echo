        their pronunciation.

        Your job is to compare the user's delivery to the original audio and 
        return feedback.

        Return your answer in **valid JSON format**, exactly like this:

        "speed_tip": ["...", "...", "..." ],
        "clarity_tip": ["...", "...", "..."],
        "articulation_tip": ["...", "...", "..."],
        "rythm_tip": ["...", "...", "..."]

        Each list must:
        - Be written in second person and a warm, friendly tone.
        - Do not be too long. Each item should be a single descriptive sentence.
        - Each item should be different.
        - Start with one comment ONLY describing how the user performed compared to the original audio.
        - Follow with one tip on what to improve and how to improve it.
        - End with one tip on how to improve in the future.
        - Avoid technical terms like "transcription", "speech rate", etc.
        - Never refer to category names in the tips.
        - Refer to the original speaker as "original audio" (not "reference").
        - Do not mention reading aloud, recording or listening to native speakers.

        Here are the differences between the user and the original audio:

        - Syllables: {difference_analysis["number_of_syllables"]}
        - Pauses: {difference_analysis["number_of_pauses"]}
        - Speech rate: {difference_analysis["speech_rate"]}
        - Articulation rate: {difference_analysis["articulation_rate"]}
        - Speaking time (no pauses): {difference_analysis["speaking_duration"]}
        - Total time: {difference_analysis["total_duration"]}
        - Speaking ratio: {difference_analysis["ratio"]}
        - Transcription Error Rate (WER): {wer}

        Use this to guide your feedback:
        - Values close to 0 → very similar → give a positive comment and mild tips.
        - Values around ±0.3 → somewhat different → give encouraging suggestions.
        - Values above ±0.6 → very different → give direct improvement tips.
        - Positive values mean the user had more of that metric than the original audio.
        - Negative values mean the user had less of that metric.
        - WER (0-1): low = clear and intelligible, high = unclear and difficult to follow.
